(Optional) Any shortcomings of your project: What were you unable to get working? 
	There is a test case I have not been able to figure out. Hence, I am unfortunately not able to tell what I could not get working.

Why could you not get it working? 
	Even after a long process of testing, I was not able to tell why. I would say it was due to the time it took to me to fully understand
	all the details about this project. Keeping up with so many details was challenging.

What is needed to finish the project?
	Definitely more time. I was thinking I could have encapsulated several implementations a whole lot better, and make every module
	truly independent from one another. However, due to time I was not able to make it.

(Optional) Any strengths of your project: ways in which your program goes above and beyond the basic requirements.
	I do not think if this program really goes above and beyond; however, it felt really good writing it in an object-oriented style 
	implementation. 

Write a few sentences regarding the module design. Do you feel like it made your code easier or harder to write? 
	It was challenging at first, but afterwards it would get easier.
	
Do you feel like it improved reusability?
	Definitely! I acknowledge that it is not as reusable, but it has the potential to be. Due to time, I was not able to fully
	design it as independent modules.
